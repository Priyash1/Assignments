    "What is 'Dataframe' in pandas and how is it different from pandas.series\n",
    "? Explain with example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure,\n",
    "similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. It consists of rows and columns,\n",
    "where each column can hold data of a different data type (e.g., integer,\n",
    "float, string). A DataFrame is the primary data structure used for data\n",
    "manipulation and analysis in pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array\n",
    "that can hold data of a single data type. It can be thought of as a\n",
    "single column from a DataFrame. A Series has both data and an associated\n",
    "index that labels each element of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate the difference between DataFrame and Series with an\n",
    "example: import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 1: Creating a DataFrame<a href=\"#Example-1:-Creating-a-DataFrame\" class=\"anchor-link\">¶</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "data = { 'Name': \\['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'\\], 'Age': \\[25, 30, 35\\],\n",
    "'City': \\['New York', 'London', 'Tokyo'\\] }\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data) print(\"DataFrame:\") print(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a DataFrame with three columns ('Name',\n",
    "'Age', and 'City') and three rows of data. Each column can be considered\n",
    "a Series, with its own data and index. For instance, if we access the\n",
    "'Name' column, we will get a Series:\n",
    "\n",
    "name_series = df\\['Name'\\] print(\"Series - Name:\") print(name_series)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shows a Series with index (0, 1, 2) and data ('Alice', 'Bob',\n",
    "'Charlie').\n",
    "\n",

    "Panel: Mutable Panels were a data structure in pandas for 3-dimensional\n",
