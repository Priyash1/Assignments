    "A thread is a unit of execution within a process. Multithreading refers to concurrently executing multiple threads by rapidly switching the control of the CPU between threads (called context switching). Multithreading in Python streamlines the efficient utilization of resources as the threads share the same memory and data space. It also allows the concurrent appearance of multiple tasks and reduces the response time. This improves the performance.Threading module is used to handle threads in python."

    "Suppose, for example, that you have two threads—one is responsible for opening a file and the other is responsible for writing to the file. It is important that you control the second thread so that it’s assured that the first thread has opened the file. If not, under some conditions the first thread will open the file, and the second thread will work fine; under other unpredictable conditions, the first thread won’t finish opening the file before the second thread tries to write to it, and you’ll throw an exception (or worse, your program will simply seize up and die). This is a race condition, and race conditions can be very difficult to debug.\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two threads each lock a different variable at the same time and then try to lock the variable that the other thread already locked. As a result, each thread stops executing and waits for the other thread to release the variable. Because each thread is holding the variable that the other thread wants, nothing occurs, and the threads remain deadlocked."
